# Raspberry Pi based autopilot for iRobot Roomba

Camera equipped Raspberry Pi watches Roomba from a distance and remotely controls its motion, in order to guide it from room to room.

This branch contains a sketch for Arduino Pro Mini that is interfaced to Raspberry Pi over a serial connection. The Mini provides communication with iRobot Roomba through XL4432 433MHz radio link.
